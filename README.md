## ⚙️ Setting Up mfakitv5

After extraction and software installation:

### 1. Open Command Prompt

- Press **Windows Key + R**, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.

### 2. Navigate to the mfakitv5 folder

- In the Command Prompt, type:
  
  ```
  cd path\to\mfakitv5
  ```

  Replace `path\to\mfakitv5` with the actual folder location on your computer.

Example:  
```
cd Desktop\mfakitv5
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Type the following command and press Enter:

```
composer install
```

This command downloads all necessary PHP packages for the app to work.

### 4. Set Up Environment File

- In the mfakitv5 folder, find the file named `.env.example`.
- Make a copy of this file and rename it to `.env`.

This file contains settings that tell mfakitv5 how to run.

### 5. Generate Application Key

Run this command:

```
php artisan key:generate
```

This creates a secure key needed for your app.

### 6. Configure Database

mfakitv5 needs a database to store information. For simple use, install **SQLite** or **MySQL**.

- If you use MySQL, open the `.env` file with a text editor.
- Find the database section and add your database name, username, and password.

Example for MySQL:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=mfakitv5db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

Create the database `mfakitv5db` in MySQL before proceeding.

### 7. Run Database Migrations

Run:

```
php artisan migrate
```

This sets up tables needed for the app.
